# Appropriations Framework ontology

This ontology is an [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) interpretation of the Appropriations Framework that is maintained by the Australian Federal Government's [Department of Finance](https://www.finance.gov.au/).

It is not, yet, a comprehensive modelling of all of the concerns of the Appropriations Framework and certainly not of all issues relating to the Appropriations Framework, such as Portfolio Budget Statements.

It only addresses some aspects of the Appropriations Framework necessary to classify government Entities. This is due to the focus of the development of this ontology: to assist with the creation of a 'Longitudinal Spine' of government functions.
